# BSV WALLET TOOLBOX FOR GO LANG

BSV BLOCKCHAIN | BRC100 Conforming Wallet, Wallet Storage and Wallet Signer Components

## Objective

The BSV Wallet Toolbox builds on the [SDK](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/go-sdk).

It aims to support building sophisticated applications and services on the BSV Blockchain technology stack.

By providing interlocking building blocks for persistent storage and protocol based key derivation, it serves as an essential toolbox for developers looking to build on the BSV Blockchain.

## Documentation

[//]: # (TODO: ADD DOCUMENTATION)

The Toolbox is richly documented with code-level annotations. This should show up well within editors like VSCode.
